### README for the Symbol Validation Exercise

#### Problem Description
The goal of this exercise is to develop a function that validates whether a text string contains the correct combination and order of parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`. The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the string is valid.

#### Justification for Data Structure Choice
For this problem, an **Array** has been chosen to be used as a stack. Arrays in JavaScript are highly versatile data structures that allow efficient implementation of stacks through methods such as `.push()` to add at the end and `.pop()` to remove from the end. This choice is suitable because a stack is ideal for solving problems related to the processing of balanced symbols, where only the most recently added element needs to be worked with until its pair is found.

#### Algorithmic Complexity
The implemented function operates with an algorithmic complexity of **O(n)**, where "n" is the length of the input string. This is because each character in the string is processed once, performing insertion or removal operations on the stack that are constant time operations (O(1)) when using an Array as a stack.

#### Nature of Arrays in JavaScript
In JavaScript, Arrays are hybrid data structures that function as dynamic lists. Unlike arrays in low-level languages, JavaScript Arrays do not require an initial size declaration and can dynamically change in size. Arrays can contain elements of different types and are capable of utilizing high-level functions such as `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()`, which makes them extremely flexible and powerful for a wide range of algorithmic applications.

In terms of their internal structure, JavaScript Arrays are not "pure arrays" as in low-level programming languages where elements are stored contiguously in memory. Rather, they are objects with keys that act as indices. This structure makes them more similar to random access lists, but they are not linked lists in the traditional sense, as individual element access is done in constant time.

#### Choice Based on Efficiency and Flexibility
The decision to use an Array as a stack in this problem is based both on efficiency and flexibility. Using an Array allows for leveraging native, fast, and efficient methods to manage the stack, and the dynamic size support ensures that the stack can grow as needed depending on the structure of the input string, all while maintaining linear time complexity.
